Requirements:
  * mencoder
  * mtn (movie thumbnailer)
  * python imaging library
  * python-magic
  * parallel python
  * yamdi

Configuration.

In the `default.py` file all default values for parameters which can be altered. To specify your
own value for any of parameters you should define new value in your `settings.py` adding 'TERRA_'
prefix to the name of paramter. For instance, if you wanted to change video encoding bitrate you
would add something like 'TERRA_ENCODING_VBITRATE = 1000' to your `settings.py` file.

Brief explanation of parameters meaning.

PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT - default width and height of player
PLAYER_VOLUME - default volume (per cents)
PLAYER_AUTOPLAY - whether playback should begin right after page loading
PLAYER_LOOP - whether player have to loop movie playback: 
PLAYER_MUTE - whether player will be muted by default
PLAYER_THUMBNAILS - whether movie thumbnails should be displayed along with player
PLAYER_EMBED_CODE - whether player embed code should be displayed: 

VIDEO_DIR - directory in which video is stored. Time formatting can be used as usual.
TEMP_VIDEO_DIR - directory for temporary video files

Encoding related parameters:

ENCODING_AFREQ - audio frequency
ENCODING_ABITRATE - audio bitrate
ENCODING_FRAMERATE - video framerate
ENCODING_VBITRATE - video bitrate
ENCODING_WIDTH - encoded video width
ENCODING_HEIGHT - encoded video height
ENCODING_LOG_FILE - encoding log file. This file is separate for every video. If you do not want to
have this type of log you can specify '/dev/null' on Unix system or possibly 'nul' on Windows (the
latter was not tested). For some videos this file can become unreasonably big so it can safely be
deleted after encoding using `clean_auxiliarry_files` method of video object.

Thumbnail generation related parameters:

THUMBNAIL_TIMESTEP - this specifies an interval of time between two thumbnails
THUMBNAIL_WIDTH - this parameters can be used to resize thumbnails (keeping aspect) to the specified
width. If it's `None` (which is default) then thumbnails are of the video size.
THUMBNAIL_MINIMUM_NUMBER - this defines the minimum quantity of thumbnails to be generated. So you
will have at least THUMBNAIL_MINIMUM_NUMBER of thumbnails for every video which is useful for tiny
videos with duration less then THUMBNAIL_TIMESTEP * THUMBNAIL_MINIMUM_NUMBER.
THUMBNAIL_LOG_FILE - the save as ENCODING_LOG_FILE but for thumbnails. And it does not have a size
issue.
THUMBNAIL_DIR - the name of directory for thumbnails in every video directory


Debug options:
LOG_FUNCTION - function which is used to log on errors. 



Bugs and issues.

In order to generate thumbnails our application uses mtn. But mtn in some cases may be imprecise in
detecting a position of thumbnail in a movie. So jumping to the certain place in a video by clicking
on thumbnails sometimes is buggy either.
